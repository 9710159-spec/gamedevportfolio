### SpaceGame

Spacegame is a fast-paced arcade-style shooter where players control a spaceship that navigates space, avoids falling rocks, and shoots lasers to destroy them. The player collects power-ups to restore health or gain extra turrets, while dodging or shooting increasingly frequent rocks. Stars drift down the screen for visual effect, and a scoreboard displays current score, health, rocks passed, and ammo. The game starts from a title screen and ends when the spaceship's health runs out. Timers control the spawn rate of rocks and power-ups, and the player fires lasers with mouse clicks.
